    "**Description of our data:**\n",
    "This data set was uploaded by user *Daniel Grijalva* and was found in *Kaggle*, the dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies). This dataset compiles different aspect of the film industry from 1980 to 2020. In this data we can observe different patterns like the most commons release dates for films, the highest grossing genres of movies, as well as consumers best rated movies. We will use this information for **nlahnlahnlah**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Description of our variables:**\n",
    "- **Name:** Title of the film. This helps us differentiate between each film. \n",
    "- **Rating:** Given to each movie by the Classification and Ratings Administration (CARA), the rating provides information needed to determine of a film is suitable for children. We can use this information to see the difference between movies rated for everyone and for a specific group of consumers. \n",
    "- **Genre:** Is a thematic category given to a film depending on theme, plot, topics and other conventions. This information can help us determine what types of genres are the more popular, highest grossing, and more common. \n",
    "- **Year:** Release year of the film. Ranges from 1980 to 2020. We can use this to sed the difference between consuming movies in the past and present. \n",
    "- **Released:** Exact date when the film was released and place of release. This data can be presented in a more useful way by separating the information into two different columns. We can see what is the most commons and uncommon release date for a movie and see how it affects different aspects of the film. \n",
    "- **Score:** Rating given to a film by users of [iMDb.com](https://www.imdb.com) on a scale of 1 to 10 depending on enjoyability of the film. This can help us see any correlation between what consumers like and the different variables like genre, release date, and director.\n",
    "- **Director:** Person who manages the film's creative aspects, like directing the film crew and actors. With the data we have we can see who the highest grossing directors are or the most well rated director. \n",
    "- **Writer:** Person who writed the script for the movie. This information is not relevant to our project.\n",
    "- **Star:** Most known actor in that is in the movie. This information is not relevant to our project.\n",
    "- **Country:** Place where the movie was released for it's premiere, decided by the producers and film company. We can see how the director or production company can affect the country of release for a film. \n",
    "- **Budget:** Amount of money alloted to the film's creation by the producers and film company, presented in US dollars. With this information we can see if a film was profitable or lost money, and we can also see if different directors/film company have any tendencies to having a bigger budget with certain variables. \n",
    "- **Gross:** Refers to gross box office earnings of a movie in U.S. dollars, this does not include any other forms of revenue. This can be used to see any impact that user score has, what genres are the most profitable, and many more correlations.\n",
    "- **Company:** Business in charge of producing the film. We can see what type of film genre is most common with what film company, as well as the success that the companies films have. \n",
    "- **Runtime:** Total amount of time from start to finish that the film lasts. Presented in minutes. With this information we can see if the duration of the movie has any effect on budget, rating, or score. "
